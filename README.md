- 👋 Hi, I’m @AAEsquire
- 👀 I’m interested in blockchain, legal and solving complex problems
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on legal AI projects
- 📫 How to reach me @ aaron@aaarchambaultlaw.com

- ⚡ Fun fact: without a problem, there can be no solutions, and without solutions, no new problems arise, so what came first, the solutions or the problems?
